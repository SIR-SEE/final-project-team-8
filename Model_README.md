Covid-19 model \n
We chose the SIR-model code that we previously worked with as our base for our model.
To make the model more realistic we added a mortality rate (m) to distinguish between those who recover and those who don't. 
We also added a parameter, epsilon, to simulate the effects safety precautions, such as restrictions, mask mandates etc.
