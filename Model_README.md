Covid-19 model 

We chose the SIR-model code that we previously worked with as our base for our model.
To make the model more realistic we added a mortality rate (m) to distinguish between those who recover and those who don't. 
We also added a parameter, epsilon, to simulate the effects safety precautions, such as restrictions, mask mandates etc.
We chose a very arbitrary number to represent the restrictions. We perhaps could have made a more in-depth equation for calculating 
the effects of safety precautions but thought it was sufficient as a visual representation.
